    <h3>Description</h2>
      <p class="description">The roasting step for this roasted cherry tomato soup may sound time-consuming, but it is not. This easy, delicious soup will still be on the table in 30 minutes, and most of that time is hands-off.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>20 ounces cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch thick sticks</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, peeled</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with foil.</li>
        <li>Spread vegetables out on the prepared pan. Drizzle with olive oil; toss to coat. Sprinkle salt and Italian seasoning evenly over vegetables.</li>
        <li>Roast vegetables in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill a high powered blender (such as a Vitamix) halfway with roasted vegetables and any accumulated juices. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend, about 45 seconds. Pour into a saucepan. Repeat with remaining roasted vegetables.</li>
        <li>Pour water into the soup; add cream. Stir to combine and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings.</li>
        <li>Ladle into soup bowls. Garnish with basil and thyme, and sprinkle with crushed red pepper flakes if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
